# each regularizer r_i is multiplied by a non-negative tau_i and added to the likelihood formula

# tau coefficients can take either a float or a trajectory definition
# alpha_iter can take either a float or a trajectory definition

# for smoothing tau = 1 is a good choice. It simpy enables smoothing (like LDA does)

# for sparsing it is recommended, according to theory, to keep the regularizer deactivated for a number of epochs initially and then to make the tau coefficient follow a dynamic trajectory:
# 'start' indicates the number of initial dataset iterations (epochs) to keep the regularizer deactivated. Basically sets tau to 0 (zero).
# a syntax like 'linear_-1_-10 should be used to indicate a trajectory; eg the tau will start from value -1 and linearly reach -10, as the epochs progress

# EG: epoch=10, start=2, tau=linear_-5_-19 will result tau having values [0, 0, -5, -7, -9, -11, -13, -15, -17, -19] (each element corresponds to 1 epoch)

# alpha_iter evaluates to a list of additional coefficients of regularization on each iteration over document. Basically for every iteration over a document (not dataset) the user
# has the option of using a different coefficient, instead of a constant one. If float then all document passes use the same coefficient. Similarly to tau, you can input a trajectory.
# if alpha iter not set it defaults to a constant coefficient of 1
